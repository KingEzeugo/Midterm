Welcome to my midterm project. For this project we are told to work with GitHub and meet the requirements. Though I am new to GitHub and are still fresh to the learning curve this project is an excellent way of learning. Please take your time to look around and enjoy my GitHub pages.

 # Here is a list of things I enjoy and why:

  1. _Books_
     * You can always find something great to read and there is a book for every one.
     * It helps me escape the real world and see things from the main characters perspective as if I am them.
  2. _Cooking_
     * I enjoy trying to create new and different meals.
     * Cooking allows me to create Nigerian dishes so I can feel connected to my home.
  3. _Soccer_
     * It's a sport I conncected with my grandpa with
     * It's the best sport in my opinion, I enjoy all aspects of the game


# I would also like to place the link to my linked in page here. 
 
 * Here it is [link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-ezeugo-705420222/). Feel free to connect with me.
